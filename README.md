# Hello World :ok_hand:

I am Richard Baltrusch, a German software engineer that likes to build all kinds of stuff, preferably in Python.

## Languages

- Professionally MATLAB, Python and Simulink.
- Currently learning Java for Android development.
- Interested in Scala, Go and Rust.

## Interests

- Games: I wrote a game engine and used it for my first game, [Bullet Sudoku](https://github.com/rbaltrusch#bullet-sudoku), a 2D top-down platformer.
- Languages: I am interested in constructed languages and [custom programming languages](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter).
- Music: I compose and [procedurally generate music](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/music_generation).

## Going forward

1) Planning to release my game [Bullet Sudoku](https://github.com/rbaltrusch#bullet-sudoku) in the coming months.
1) Planning on expanding the currently very limited vocabulary of my custom scripting language [Natscript](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter).
1) I suppose my [chess engine](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/chess_engine) could need a lot more work... :shrug:

## Bullet Sudoku

Bullet Sudoku is a small game I wrote in summer 2020 using my custom made game engine written in Python. I plan to release the game in the coming months.

The source code is currently not open-source, but I plan on releasing a condensed open-source version of the game engine in the near future.

## Tools

### Batest

[Batest](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/batest) is a lightweight unit testing framework for Windows batchfile scripts. As no testing framework existed when I was learning [Batch](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/batch), I wrote my own :+1:.

It generates simple HTML test reports like this:

### Music analysis

Here's my music analysis tool, which I started building in 2018 and recently built a fancy user interface for:

## Shop application

Here's a small shop application I made to solidify my understanding of SQL and handling confidential data securely in databases.

### Object oriented batch

For people unfortunate enough to come to Batch with an object oriented background, I wrote an [object oriented framework for Batch](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/objectbatch/wiki), including classes and instances, methods and attributes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and object composition.

<sub>It's probably not very useful, but at least it was fun to make :100::100:</sub>
