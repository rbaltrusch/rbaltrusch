### Hello World :ok_hand:

I am Richard Baltrusch, a German software engineer that likes to build all kinds of stuff, preferably in Python.

## Languages

- Professionally MATLAB, Python and Simulink.
- Currently learning Java for Android development.
- Interested in Scala, Go and Rust.

## Interests

- Games: I play many video games and have written a game engine, which I used to write my first 2D top-down platformer, [Bullet Sudoku](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/rbaltrusch/edit/master/README.md#bullet-sudoku).
- Music: I compose and [procedurally generate music](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/music_generation).
- Languages: I am interested in constructed languages and [custom programming languages](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter).

## Going forward

1) Planning to release my game [Bullet Sudoku](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/rbaltrusch/edit/master/README.md#bullet-sudoku) in the coming months, as well as write a few more games using my game engine. I am also planning to release a concise, open-source version of my game engine.
1) I suppose my [chess engine](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/chess_engine) could need a lot more work... :shrug:
1) Planning on expanding the currently very limited vocabulary of my custom scripting language [Natscript](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter).

## Bullet Sudoku

Bullet Sudoku is a small game I wrote in summer 2020 using my custom made game engine written in Python, which I plan to release in the coming months.

The source code is currently not open-source, but I plan on releasing a condensed open-source version of the game engine in the near future.

## Tools

### Batest

[Batest](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/batest) is a lightweight unit testing framework for Windows batchfile scripts. As no testing framework existed when I was learning [Batch](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/batch), I wrote my own :+1:.

### Music analysis

Here's my music analysis tool, which I started building in 2018 and recently built a fancy user interface for:

### Object oriented batch

For people unfortunate enough to come to Batch with an object oriented background, I wrote an [object oriented framework for Batch](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/objectbatch/wiki), including classes and instances, methods and attributes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and object composition.

<sub><sup>It's probably not very useful, but at least it was fun to make :100::100:</sup></sub>
